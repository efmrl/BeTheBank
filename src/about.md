## The Scenario

You and your friends meet for a meal. You like to pay on one check,
with cash.

But sometimes, you're out of cash. Never fear, you can collect
everyone else's cash, and pay the whole bill with credit card.  You
can be the bank.

Now you've paid your part, and you have cash left over for next
time.

## The Problem

But how much of a tip do you write in? Do you go for 20%? But what
if everyone else was a generous tipper; now you're underpaying, and
undertipping. Or the opposite could be true.

## The Solution

Enter the amount of the bill, and the amount of cash everyone has
paid. Decide between setting the tip, or setting your payment.

### Setting the Tip

Enter your desired tip percentage. We'll tell you how much tip to
add, the total, and how much you end up paying: the total amount
paid, less the cash you collected.

### Setting your Payment

If you know how much you wish to pay, enter that. We'll tell you
what percent of a tip you'll be leaving, the amount to write in for
the tip, and the total.
